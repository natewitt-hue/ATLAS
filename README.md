# ATLAS™ — Autonomous TSL League Administration System

Discord bot powering **TSL (The Simulation League)**, a long-running Madden NFL simulation league with ~31 active human-controlled teams across 95+ Super Bowl seasons.

## Architecture

```
MaddenStats API (mymadden.com/api/lg/tsl)
    │
    │  REST — standings, schedules, rosters, stats, players
    ▼
data_manager.py  →  pandas DataFrames  →  Cog commands / Gemini AI
    │
    ▼
tsl_history.db (SQLite)  ←  build_tsl_db.py
    │
    ▼
Discord (slash commands, embeds, hub views, select menus)
```

Bot runs locally on Windows. Python 3.14, discord.py 2.3+ with app_commands, cog-based architecture.

## External Integrations

- **MaddenStats API** — `https://mymadden.com/api/lg/tsl` — league data source
- **Claude AI** (primary) + **Gemini AI** (fallback) — Text-to-SQL, analytics narration, persona voice via `atlas_ai.py`
- **Polymarket Gamma API** — real-world prediction markets with 6-layer curation filter (`polymarket_cog.py`)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ADMIN_USER_IDS=comma_separated_discord_ids
   ORACLE_DB_PATH=path_to_tsl_history.db
   ```

3. Run the bot:
   ```
   python bot.py
   ```

## Rendering Stack

All visual cards use a unified HTML-to-PNG pipeline:

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Style Tokens | `atlas_style_tokens.py` | Single source of truth for colors, fonts, spacing |
| HTML Engine | `atlas_html_engine.py` | Playwright page pool + `render_card()` / `wrap_card()` |
| Casino | `casino/renderer/casino_html_renderer.py` | Blackjack, Slots, Crash, Coinflip, Scratch |
| Predictions | `casino/renderer/prediction_html_renderer.py` | Market List, Detail, Bet, Portfolio, Resolution, Daily Drop |
| Highlights | `casino/renderer/highlight_renderer.py` | Jackpot, PvP, Crash LMS, Prediction, Parlay |

Pipeline: Build HTML body → `wrap_card(body, status)` → `render_card(html)` → PNG bytes (700px, 2x DPI, 4-page pool)

## Theme System

ATLAS supports per-user card themes selectable from the Flow Hub. Themes override style tokens (colors, overlays, gradients) without touching card layout logic.

| Theme | ID | Palette |
|-------|----|---------|
| Obsidian Gold | `obsidian_gold` | Black + warm gold — default |
| Miami Vice | `miami_vice` | Cyan + hot pink neon |
| Digital Rain | `digital_rain` | Matrix green on black |
| Midnight Circuit | `midnight_circuit` | Deep navy + electric blue |
| Venom Strike | `venom_strike` | Toxic green + dark chrome |
| Arctic Fox | `arctic_fox` | Ice white + polar blue |
| Shadow Broker | `shadow_broker` | Crimson + obsidian |
| Glacier Mint | `glacier_mint` | Mint green + frosted glass |
| Blackout Protocol | `blackout_protocol` | Pure black + white accents |

Theme registry: `atlas_themes.py` · Theme picker: `ThemeSelectView` in `economy_cog.py` · Design tool: `atlas_theme_studio.jsx`
